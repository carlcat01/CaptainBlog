		<p>The past few days aboard the Canterbury have been relativly repeatative.  Captain McDowel called me in today to try and talk me into a promotion.  Like before I turned it down.  Never really liked the extra paperwork it adds, and besides, I would have less time in the CIC. Otherwise, the crew has been going well so far, many are the same as the privous runs, but a few are new.  So far I think I'll sign up for a few more.  </p>

		<p>Today there was a distressed call picked up by the Cant.  With the cost of late fees, and privous delays, Captain decided to ignore it.  Something about it just didn't sit right with me, so I just logged it with the company.  He should be getting a message to follow directives to respond.  I'm not going to tell him that it was me.</p>

		<h2>The Cantebury is Destroyed</h2>

		<p>The ice hauler, the Canterbury has destroyed.  After logging the distress call myself and four others took the shuttle to investigate.  We discovered a heavily damaged ship, cause unknown. Soon after we entered, the Cant detected another heat signature nearby that did not match any known vessels.  We immediately returned to the shuttle and started back.  The unknown vessel fired two missiles that came near us, and continued to the Cant.  The unknown ship then went dark, and masked it’s heat emissions.  I am now discussing with the four survivors what we should do.</p>

		<h2>Remeber the Cant</h2>

		<div class="text">
		<p>I released a message to all public communications relays in the area.  The enemy vessel must be Martian since the UN has no cloaking technologies.  My crew did not support my decision saying it was rash and that we don’t know what’s happening.  I do.</p>

		<p>The MCRN Donnager contacted us and has required we head for an intercept course. We have to go since we can't make it to any station before suplies run out.  I worry that once we board, the Donnager, we will be taken as prisoners and terrorists since if it was the Martians that attacked us, then we are the only thing stopping their story.  This may be my last log.</p>

		<h2>The Donnager is Destroyed</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="date">
		<h5>Posted on: 08/05/2346</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		<p>A lot has happened after my last log.  We were taken aboard the Donnager and held in the brig.  They then proceeded to interview each one of us independently.  When they interrogated me, they suggested that Niomi Nagata, our chief engineer, was part of an OPA terrorist cell.  I do not believe that.  It also tuns out that our pilot, Alex Kamal, is an honorably discharged MCRN pilot.  After the interrogations, we were but in a holding cell.  I was able to talk to the captain, but during our discussion the unknown vessels attacked.  I was able to escape with three of my original crew.  Dr. Shed was killed during the attack.  The MCRN LT and marine that got us to this new ship, the Tachi, have died.  The LT transferred control of the Tachi to me.  We barley left the hangar before the entire flagship of the MCRN, the Donnager, was destroyed.  After the attack, I now worry that it is not the Martians’, but some unknown party.  </p>

		<h2>Going to Tycho</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="date">
		<h5>Posted on: 12/05/2346</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		<p>I was contacted by Fred Johnson who was somehow able to locate our ship when it was in silent running.  He asked us to go to Tycho station, and after discussion with the crew, we accepted.  He then provided us with instructions tot change our transponder, so now the MCRN Tachi is the Rocinante.  We all have reservations about what will happen next, especially due to Fred’s controversial past. </p>

		<h2>A New Mission</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="date">
		<h5>Posted on: 15/05/2346</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		<p>The meeting with Fred was uneasy at first.  We eventually were able to make an agreement that he will support my testimony that it was not the Martians that destroyed the Canterbury.  In return I had to have to find a survivor of one his OPA ships, the Scapuli.  I have also informed him all that I know about the destruction of the Canterbury and Donnager.  He shares my thoughts that both attacks were performed by an unknown party.  The Rocinante has been fitted to appear as a gas freighter, and will be cred the three survivors and myself.  The last known location of the survivor we were looking for is on Eros station.  We will be departing shortly. </p>

		<h2>Stowaway</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="date">
		<h5>Posted on: 29/05/2346</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		<p>We had a close call with a Martian patrol.  Unbeknownst to us, a stowaway sent a message that was detected by the patrol.  After finding the stowaway, we were able to access the captains safe and convince the patrol that we are a Martian black ops ship.  We have decided to bring the stowaway to Eros as he may know where the OPA survivor is.</p>

		<h2>Extreme Value</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="date">
		<h5>Posted on: 03/06/2346</h5>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
		<p>I have received an update from Fred, the location of the Anubis.  He said that this ship destroyed the Scapuli, and was reported by the OPA survivor to be of extreme value.  Our course has been modified, and we will arrive in a few days.  Since the ship is of such value, we will be going to silent running soon.  I do not know when I can upload a new log. </p>
